## Specification Requirements

### 1. The need for compression

**Students must know:**
- **Compression** is the process of reducing the size of a file
- Files are compressed to reduce **file size** in order to:
  - Use less **storage space** (e.g. on hard drives, USB drives, cloud storage)
  - Speed up **transmission** over networks (e.g. sending via email, uploading to websites, downloading from the internet)
  - Enable files to fit within size limits (e.g. email attachment restrictions, upload limits)
- Common scenarios where compression may be needed include:
  - Emailing files as attachments
  - Uploading files to cloud storage or websites
  - Storing large numbers of files
  - Streaming media content
  - Backing up data

**Key distinction:** Compression reduces file size; this affects both storage and transmission. Students must specify WHAT is faster (e.g. "the email is sent faster" not just "it is faster") or WHAT space is reduced (e.g. "uses less storage space" not just "takes up less space").

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "reduces file size", "uses less storage space", "faster transmission", "email sent faster", "file uploaded faster"
- Do not accept: "it is faster" (without stating what), "takes up less space" (without stating storage/memory space), "compression is faster" (compression itself is not the benefit)

**Not required:** Specific compression algorithms (e.g. Run Length Encoding, Huffman coding)

### 2. Types of compression: Lossy

**Students must know:**
- **Lossy compression** permanently removes data from the file
- The original file cannot be fully reconstructed after lossy compression
- Lossy compression results in a **loss of quality**
- Lossy compression **reduces file size more** than lossless compression (or "significantly")
- Appropriate for files where small losses in quality are **not noticeable** to users:
  - **Image files** (photographs, graphics for web use)
  - **Sound files** (music, podcasts)
  - **Video files** (streaming content, social media videos)
- **NOT appropriate** for files where data loss would cause problems:
  - **Text documents** (letters, essays, code)
  - **Executable files** (programs, applications)
  - **Spreadsheets or databases**

**Key distinction:** Lossy permanently removes data vs temporarily removes data for transmission. The data is gone forever, not retrievable.

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "permanently removes data", "data is lost", "cannot be fully reconstructed", "quality is reduced", "changes may not be noticed", "removes unnoticeable detail", "file size reduced significantly"
- Do not accept: "reduces number of colours" (without stating this is not noticed), "makes it compressed more" (must explain what this means - file size reduced more), examples of lossy methods as the compression type (e.g. "reduce resolution")

**Not required:** Ability to carry out lossy compression methods

### 3. Types of compression: Lossless

**Students must know:**
- **Lossless compression** does not remove any data from the file
- The original file **can be fully reconstructed** after lossless compression (decompressed back to original)
- No loss of quality occurs
- Lossless compression reduces file size **less** than lossy compression
- Appropriate for files where **all data must be retained**:
  - **Text documents** (where every character, space, and formatting mark is needed)
  - **Executable files** (programs that would not run if corrupted)
  - **Spreadsheets** (where precise data is essential)
  - Files that require perfect accuracy
- **Required for text files** because:
  - Text files will not work/open if any data is lost
  - Characters, words, spaces, case, or formatting would be lost with lossy
  - The text would change meaning or not make sense

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "no data is lost", "data is not removed", "file can be fully reconstructed back to the original", "all data retained", "text file requires all data to work", "text will remain accurate", "text will not have changed meaning", "text will still make sense"
- Do not accept: examples of lossless methods as the compression type (e.g. "RLE"), stating "information" instead of "data" for the first mark point (but "information" acceptable in context justification)

**Not required:** Ability to carry out lossless compression algorithms

## Examiner Intelligence

### Recurring Misconceptions (flagged in examiner reports 2022-2023)

1. **"Compression makes things faster"**
   - Students write "it is faster" without specifying WHAT is faster in the context of the question. For compression benefits, the transmission/sending/downloading of the file is faster due to reduced size, NOT the compression process itself.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

2. **"Compression takes up less space"**
   - Students write "takes up less space" without clarifying this is storage space or memory space. Examiners need precision - could be interpreted as screen space without context.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

3. **"Lossy compression will make letters blurry or remove words from text files"**
   - Lossy compression does not selectively remove words or make characters blurry. Instead, the file would become **corrupted** and unusable. Text files simply cannot be properly opened after lossy compression.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

4. **"Describing HOW compression works instead of WHY it's appropriate"**
   - When asked to justify a compression choice, students describe the method (e.g. "it reduces the number of colours") rather than why this is appropriate for the context (e.g. "this change is not noticed in photographs").
   - Source: June 2022 and June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

5. **"Stating the same benefit multiple times"**
   - Students give variations of the same point (e.g. "email sent faster" and "downloaded faster") - these are the same benefit (faster transmission) just worded differently, so only score once.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

6. **"Saying 'it compresses the file more' for lossy"**
   - This is insufficient - must explain what "more" means in terms of file size reduction being greater/more significant.
   - Source: June 2022 and June 2023 J277/01 mark schemes

### Common Mark Losses

- Not providing **context** when stating benefits (e.g. "faster" instead of "email sent faster")
- Confusing **data** with **information** in first mark point (specification states data, though information acceptable in contextual justification)
- Giving examples of compression methods (RLE, reduce resolution, reduce colours) as the **type** of compression
- Not linking lossy/lossless to the **specific file type** in the question context
- Describing compression **methods** when asked for **justification** of appropriateness
- Repeating the same benefit worded differently (counts as one mark only)

### Question Patterns (2022-2025)

- **Frequency:** Compression appears in **every** June examination paper 2022-2023 (100% coverage in available past papers with detailed examiner reports)
- **2024-2025 Note:** ⚠️ Examiner reports for 2024-2025 state "no particular areas to highlight" for compression - indicating good overall performance with no recurring issues
- **Format patterns (from 2022-2023):**
  - Benefits of compression (2 marks): "Give two benefits of compressing data before emailing" - June 2022 J277/01 Q6(d)(i)
  - Explain inappropriateness (2 marks): "Explain why lossy compression may not be appropriate" - June 2022 J277/01 Q6(d)(ii)
  - Identify and justify (3 marks each): "Identify the most suitable type of compression... Justify your choice" - June 2023 J277/01 Q3(c)(i) and (ii)
- **Typical contexts:**
  - Student emailing files to teacher
  - Text documents vs image files
  - Requiring maximum file size reduction
- **Mark allocation:** Usually 2-3 marks per sub-question, 4-6 marks total per compression question
- **Command words:** Give, Explain, Identify, Justify (most common: Justify - requires application to context)

## Quick Reference

### Compression Type Selection

| File Type | Compression Type | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Text documents | **Lossless** | All characters, spaces, formatting must be retained; file will not work if data is lost |
| Photographs/images | **Lossy** (most appropriate) | Quality loss not noticed; file size reduced significantly |
| Professional images | Lossless | Quality/detail must be retained |
| Sound files | **Lossy** (most appropriate) | Quality loss not noticed by most users |
| Video files | **Lossy** (most appropriate) | Quality loss not noticed; file size reduced significantly |
| Executable files | **Lossless** | Program will not run if corrupted |
| Spreadsheets/databases | **Lossless** | Precise data must be retained |

### Key Exam Language

**For benefits of compression (any type):**
- "Reduces file size"
- "Uses less storage space / less memory space"
- "File transmitted faster / sent faster / uploaded faster / downloaded faster"
- "Email sent/received faster"
- "Allows file to be sent / fit within size limits"

**For lossy compression - why appropriate:**
- "Reduces file size more / significantly more than lossless"
- "Quality loss not noticed by user"
- "Changes not noticeable"
- "Removes unnoticeable / unnecessary detail"
- "Data loss acceptable for this file type"

**For lossy compression - why NOT appropriate:**
- "File will become corrupted / will not work / will not open"
- "All data required for text file to work"
- "Loss of any character/word/space would change meaning"
- "Text would not make sense"

**For lossless compression - why appropriate:**
- "No data is lost / removed"
- "File can be fully reconstructed back to original"
- "All data must be retained for file to work"
- "Text file requires all characters/formatting"
- "Quality/detail retained"

**For lossless compression - limitation:**
- "Reduces file size less than lossy"
- "File size reduction may still be substantial"

### Common Errors to Avoid

- "It is faster" -> "The email is sent faster"
- "Takes up less space" -> "Uses less storage space"
- "Letters become blurry" -> "Text file becomes corrupted and unusable"
- "RLE" (as compression type) -> "Lossless"
- "It compresses more" -> "It reduces file size more significantly"
- "Removes colours" (without context) -> "Reduces colours but this is not noticed in photographs"
- Describing HOW it compresses -> Explaining WHY this type is appropriate for the file/context
