## Specification Requirements

### 1. The need for secondary storage

**Students must know:**
- **Secondary storage** is needed to store data and files long-term and permanently
- Without secondary storage, user files would not be stored when the power is turned off
- Secondary storage stores data not currently being used by the processor
- Secondary storage is **non-volatile** -- data is retained when the computer is powered off

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "to store data/files long-term/permanently"
- Accept: "without secondary the user's files will not be stored when the power is turned off"
- Accept: "store data not currently being used"
- Do not accept: "to backup data" without reference to long-term/permanence

**Not required:**
- Understanding of file systems or directory structures
- Details of how data is physically written to storage media

---

### 2. Common types of storage

**Students must know:**
- The three main types of secondary storage: **optical**, **magnetic**, and **solid state**
- Recognise a range of secondary storage devices and media
- Understand the differences between each type of storage device/medium

**Optical storage:**
- Examples: CD, DVD, Blu-ray disc
- Uses laser light to read and write data
- Data stored as pits and lands on a disc surface

**Magnetic storage:**
- Examples: Hard disk drive (HDD), magnetic tape
- Uses magnetism to store data
- Contains moving parts (spinning disks and read/write heads)

**Solid state storage:**
- Examples: SSD (solid state drive), USB memory stick, flash memory card, SD card
- Uses electronic circuits with no moving parts
- Stores data in flash memory chips

**Marking language:**
- Accept: Any valid secondary storage device
- Accept: "BOD 'optical disc'" (benefit of doubt)
- Do not accept: Types of storage (e.g., magnetic/optical/solid state) when a specific **device** is requested
- Do not accept: RAM or ROM as secondary storage devices
- Do not accept: "USB" on its own -- must specify "USB memory stick" or "USB drive"

**Not required:**
- Understanding of the component parts of storage devices
- Detailed technical mechanisms of how data is stored physically

---

### 3. Suitable storage devices and storage media for a given application

**Students must know:**
- How to select appropriate storage for specific scenarios and use cases
- How to justify choices based on the characteristics required for the application
- Be able to apply their knowledge in context within scenarios

**Key principle:**
Application to context is essential. Generic answers without scenario-specific justification do not gain full credit.

**Marking language:**
- Accept: Type by example (e.g., "SSD" instead of stating "solid state")
- Accept: Justification marks for using one type or not using another type
- Accept: Reverse arguments (e.g., "magnetic is not as robust but the computer will not be moved")
- No mark awarded for the choice itself -- all marks are for the justification

**Not required:**
- Knowledge of specific brand names or manufacturers
- Detailed pricing comparisons beyond general cost principles

---

### 4. Advantages and disadvantages of different storage devices and storage media

**Students must know:**
- How to compare storage types using the following six characteristics:
  - **Capacity** -- how much data can be stored
  - **Speed** -- how fast data can be read/written/accessed
  - **Portability** -- physical size, weight, ease of transport
  - **Durability** -- resistance to damage, robustness
  - **Reliability** -- consistency of operation over time
  - **Cost** -- price per unit of storage

**Key characteristics by storage type:**

| Characteristic | Optical | Magnetic | Solid State |
|----------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Capacity** | Moderate (GB range) | High (TB range) | High (TB range) |
| **Speed** | Slowest | Moderate | Fastest |
| **Portability** | Small, lightweight | Varies (HDD large, tape bulky) | Very small, lightweight |
| **Durability** | Fragile (scratches) | Moderate (moving parts) | Robust (no moving parts) |
| **Reliability** | Good if undamaged | Good if stationary | Very good |
| **Cost** | Cheapest per unit | Moderate per GB | More expensive per GB |

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "Fast to read/write/access data" (must specify what is fast)
- Accept: "BOD faster to transfer the data for read/write/access"
- Accept: "Durable/robust // Less likely to be damaged/break"
- Accept: "No moving parts // because it does not get scratched like a disk"
- Accept: "Larger capacity (than optical) // store more data"
- Accept: "Small in (physical) size // lightweight"
- Accept: "Cost per unit is less // Cost for the same amount of storage is less"
- Do not accept: "Longevity/reliability" for solid state over magnetic (common misconception)
- Do not accept: "Fast" without specifying what aspect (read/write/access/transfer)

**Not required:**
- Specific capacity values for different devices
- Detailed technical reasons for speed differences
- Understanding of MTBF (mean time between failures) calculations

## Examiner Intelligence

### Recurring Misconceptions (flagged in examiner reports 2022-2025)

1. **"Secondary storage is used when primary storage is full"**
   - Secondary storage is for long-term, permanent storage of data and files. It is NOT primarily used as overflow when primary storage fills up. That is the purpose of virtual memory.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

2. **"Secondary storage is only used as a backup"**
   - Secondary storage is the main location for storing data long-term and permanently, not just for backup purposes. Users actively save and load files from secondary storage.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports (NBOD -- "to backup data" without reference to long-term/permanence)

3. **Giving storage type instead of specific device**
   - When asked for a secondary storage device, students often give "magnetic" or "optical" instead of "hard drive" or "CD". The question asks for a device, not a type.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

4. **Identifying RAM or ROM as secondary storage**
   - RAM and ROM are primary storage, not secondary storage. This is a fundamental classification error.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

5. **"USB" on its own**
   - "USB" is insufficient -- must specify "USB memory stick" or "USB drive". USB is a connection standard, not a storage device.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 mark schemes

6. **"Solid state is faster" without specifying what**
   - Stating a device is "faster" without referencing what it is faster at (reading data, writing data, accessing data, transferring files) is too vague.
   - Source: June 2024, June 2025 J277/01 examiner reports

7. **"Solid state has more longevity than magnetic"**
   - This is a misconception. Solid state devices do NOT have unlimited life span and will NOT necessarily outlast magnetic storage. Both have finite write cycles and operational lifespans.
   - Source: June 2024 J277/01 examiner report (explicitly flagged as misconception)

8. **Repeating the same storage type**
   - When asked to identify a **different** type of secondary storage, students often repeat magnetic or solid state instead of providing optical.
   - Source: June 2024 J277/01 examiner report

9. **Confusing capacity units**
   - Students commonly select 300MB when 200,000KB is the smallest capacity (200,000KB = 195MB approximately). Unit conversion errors are frequent.

### Common Mark Losses

- **Giving examples instead of reasons** -- listing devices when asked WHY storage is needed
- **Stating type instead of device** -- "optical" instead of "CD" or "hard drive"
- **Vague speed claims** -- saying "faster" without specifying faster at what
- **No application to scenario** -- generic justifications without relating to the given context
- **Incomplete justifications** -- not linking characteristics to scenario requirements (e.g., "high capacity" without explaining why the application needs high capacity)
- **"USB" alone** -- not specifying "USB memory stick" or "USB flash drive"
- **Confusing longevity/reliability** -- claiming solid state will outlast magnetic (do not accept)
- **Cost claims without qualification** -- must specify "per unit of data" or "per GB", not just "cheaper"
- **Identifying RAM/ROM as secondary storage** -- fundamental classification error

### Why Secondary Storage is Needed

**Main purpose:** Store data/files long-term and permanently

**Key points:**
- Without secondary storage, user files would not be retained when power is turned off
- Stores data not currently being used by the processor
- Provides permanent storage independent of power supply
- NOT primarily used when primary storage is full (that's virtual memory)
- NOT just for backup (it's the main long-term storage location)

### Justification Application Examples

**Musician recording music (needs large capacity, speed, reliability):**
- Solid state: Fast access for recording/playback; high capacity for audio files; durable if device moved
- Magnetic: Sufficient capacity; cheaper per GB; speed adequate if device stationary

**Student transferring files between computers (needs portability, sufficient capacity):**
- Solid state (USB stick): Small/lightweight; portable; durable (no moving parts to damage in transport)
- Optical: Portable; cheap per unit; sufficient capacity if files not too large

**Photographer storing high-resolution images (needs very high capacity, reliability):**
- Magnetic (HDD): Very high capacity at lower cost per GB; reliable if kept stationary
- Solid state (SSD): High capacity; very reliable; fast access to large files

**Key principle:** Always link characteristics to the specific scenario requirements.

## Exam Technique Reminders

1. **Device vs Type:** When asked for a device, give specific examples (HDD, SSD, CD) NOT types (magnetic, optical, solid state)
2. **Specify speed context:** Don't just say "faster" -- say "faster to read/write/access data"
3. **Apply to scenario:** Every justification should relate to the specific application/context given
4. **Cost must be qualified:** Say "cheaper per unit of storage" or "lower cost per GB", not just "cheaper"
5. **Link capacity to need:** Don't just say "high capacity" -- explain WHY the application needs high capacity
6. **USB must be specific:** "USB memory stick" or "USB flash drive", never "USB" alone
7. **Show working for calculations:** Partial working can earn marks even if the final answer is wrong
8. **Avoid longevity claims:** Do not claim solid state will outlast magnetic (it's a misconception)
9. **No choice marks:** When justifying storage selection, no marks for the choice -- all marks for the justification
10. **Reverse arguments acceptable:** Can justify choice by explaining why you're NOT using the alternative
