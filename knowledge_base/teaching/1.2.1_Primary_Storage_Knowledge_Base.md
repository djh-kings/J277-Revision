# Unit 1.2.1: Primary Storage (Memory)
## OCR J277 GCSE Computer Science -- Knowledge Base File

---

## Specification Requirements

### 1. The need for primary storage

**Students must know:**
- **Primary storage** (memory) is needed to store data and instructions that the processor needs to access
- Without primary storage, the computer would not be able to start up or work
- Primary storage usually consists of **RAM** and **ROM**

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "to store (active) data/instructions/software/OS that the processor needs to access"
- Accept: "(ROM) so the start-up instructions are not deleted when the computer turns off"
- Accept: "(RAM) to store the currently running data/software/instructions"
- Accept: "(Cache) to store frequently used data/instructions"
- Do not accept: examples of storage instead of why storage is needed

---

### 2. The difference between RAM and ROM

**Students must know:**
- The key characteristics that distinguish **RAM** (Random Access Memory) from **ROM** (Read Only Memory)
- **RAM is volatile** -- contents are lost when power is turned off
- **ROM is non-volatile** -- contents are retained when power is turned off
- When stating a difference, both sides must be given (e.g., "RAM is volatile, ROM is non-volatile")

**Key distinction:**
The fundamental difference is **volatility**. A difference in use (purpose) is NOT a fundamental difference between the two types of memory.

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "RAM is volatile" AND "ROM is not-volatile" (both sides required)
- Do not accept: Purpose differences as THE difference (e.g., "RAM stores running programs, ROM stores BIOS")
- Do not accept: One-sided answers (e.g., "RAM is volatile" without contrasting ROM)

---

### 3. The purpose of ROM in a computer system

**Students must know:**
- **ROM** stores permanent instructions needed for the computer to start up
- Stores the **BIOS** (Basic Input/Output System) or boot instructions
- Instructions in ROM are not deleted when the computer is powered off
- ROM stores essential system software that rarely or never needs changing

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "stores start-up instructions"
- Accept: "stores the BIOS"
- Accept: "stores instructions that do not change/are permanent"
- Accept: "stores boot sequence instructions"

---

### 4. The purpose of RAM in a computer system

**Students must know:**
- **RAM** stores data, instructions, and software that the processor is currently using
- Stores the **currently running** programs and data
- Acts as temporary workspace for the processor
- Data in RAM can be read from and written to quickly
- Contents of RAM are **volatile** -- lost when power is turned off

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "stores currently running data/software/instructions"
- Accept: "stores active applications and their data"
- Accept: "stores data being processed"
- Do not accept: generic applications (e.g., "stores a TV programme") -- must indicate the **parts currently being used**
- Application examples must show specificity: "the recording currently being watched" or "open applications" or "webpages being used"

---

### 5. Virtual memory

**Students must know:**
- **Virtual memory** is a section of **secondary storage** (not primary storage) partitioned to act as RAM
- Virtual memory is needed when **RAM is full** or nearly full
- Data is transferred from **RAM to virtual memory** when RAM capacity is reached
- Data is transferred back from **virtual memory to RAM** (not secondary storage) when needed by the processor
- Transfer of data between RAM and secondary storage occurs when RAM is full

**Key distinction:**
- Virtual memory uses **secondary storage** (e.g., hard drive, SSD), NOT primary storage
- Data moves between **RAM and virtual memory**, then back to **RAM** (not to secondary storage generally)
- Be precise: data returns to **RAM** specifically, not just "primary storage" (which includes ROM and cache)

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "A section of secondary storage is partitioned to act as virtual memory"
- Accept: "Data from RAM is transferred into VM"
- Accept: "VM is needed when RAM is full, or nearly full"
- Accept: "Data from VM is transferred back to RAM when needed"
- Do not accept: "A section of primary storage" for where VM is located
- Do not accept: "Data from ROM is transferred" (ROM does not transfer to VM)
- Do not accept: "Data from VM is transferred back to secondary storage" (must specify RAM)
- Do not accept: "primary storage" as the destination (too vague -- includes ROM and cache)

---

### 6. Cache

**Students must know:**
- **Cache** is a small amount of very fast memory located inside or very close to the CPU
- Cache stores frequently used data and instructions
- Cache allows faster access than retrieving from RAM
- When the processor needs data, it checks cache first before accessing RAM

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "stores frequently used data/instructions"
- Accept: "very fast memory close to CPU"
- Accept: "checked before RAM"

**Not required:**
- Understanding of cache levels (L1, L2, L3)
- Detailed cache replacement policies or algorithms
- Cache coherency protocols

## Examiner Intelligence

### Recurring Misconceptions (flagged in examiner reports 2022-2025)

1. **"Secondary storage is used when primary storage is full"**
   - Secondary storage is for long-term, permanent storage of data and files. It is NOT primarily used as overflow when primary storage fills up. That is the purpose of virtual memory, which uses a section of secondary storage.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

2. **"Secondary storage is only used as a backup"**
   - Secondary storage is the main location for storing data long-term and permanently, not just for backup purposes. Without secondary storage, user files would not be retained when power is turned off.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports

3. **"RAM is volatile" (without contrasting ROM)**
   - When a **difference** is required, students must give both sides. "RAM is volatile" on its own is insufficient -- they must add "ROM is non-volatile" to show the difference.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

4. **Giving the purpose of RAM and ROM as the fundamental difference**
   - The use/purpose (what they store) is NOT a fundamental difference. The key characteristic difference is volatility.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report

5. **"Data from VM is transferred back to secondary storage"**
   - When data is needed again, it moves from virtual memory back to **RAM** specifically, not to "secondary storage" generally or "primary storage" generally. Be precise.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports and mark schemes

6. **"Primary storage should be secondary storage" (for virtual memory location)**
   - Virtual memory is created from a section of **secondary storage**, not primary storage. This error occurs frequently in correction statements.
   - Source: June 2022, June 2023 J277/01 examiner reports and mark schemes

7. **Generic RAM content examples**
   - When giving examples of what RAM stores, generic answers like "a TV programme" or "applications" are too vague. Must specify the **currently running** or **actively used** portions (e.g., "the recording currently being watched", "open applications", "webpages being used").

### Common Mark Losses

- **Giving one-sided differences** -- stating only "RAM is volatile" without the ROM contrast
- **Confusing purpose with fundamental characteristics** -- describing what RAM/ROM store instead of their key properties
- **Imprecise virtual memory descriptions** -- saying data returns to "primary storage" or "secondary storage" instead of specifically "RAM"
- **Stating "primary storage" when virtual memory location is asked** -- must specify secondary storage
- **Providing examples when explanations are required** -- e.g., giving "hard drive, SSD" when asked why storage is needed
- **Confusing storage types in context** -- identifying RAM or ROM as secondary storage devices
- **Lack of application to scenario** -- generic responses without relating data to the specific context given in the question
- **"USB" on its own** -- insufficient; must specify "USB memory stick" or "USB drive" when identifying storage devices

## Quick Reference

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Primary Storage** | Memory directly accessible by the CPU; includes RAM, ROM, and cache |
| **Volatile** | Contents are lost when power is turned off (RAM, cache) |
| **Non-volatile** | Contents are retained when power is turned off (ROM, secondary storage) |
| **RAM** | Random Access Memory -- volatile memory storing currently running programs and data |
| **ROM** | Read Only Memory -- non-volatile memory storing permanent start-up instructions |
| **Virtual Memory** | Section of secondary storage used as additional RAM when primary memory is full |
| **Cache** | Very fast memory close to CPU storing frequently used instructions and data |

### The Fundamental Difference: RAM vs ROM

| RAM | ROM |
|-----|-----|
| Volatile | Non-volatile |
| Contents lost when powered off | Contents retained when powered off |
| Stores currently running data/instructions | Stores permanent start-up instructions |
| Read and write | Read only (in normal operation) |

### Virtual Memory Process

1. RAM becomes full or nearly full
2. Data is moved from RAM to a section of secondary storage (virtual memory)
3. This frees up space in RAM for new data
4. When the transferred data is needed again, it is moved from virtual memory back to RAM

### Purpose Quick Reference

**Why do computers need primary storage?**
- To store active data/instructions/software that the processor needs to access
- ROM stores start-up instructions permanently
- RAM stores currently running programs and data temporarily
- Cache stores frequently used data for fast access

**Why do computers need secondary storage?**
- To store data/files long-term and permanently
- User files would not be retained when power is turned off without it
- Stores data not currently being used by the processor

### Application to Scenarios: RAM Content Examples

**Smart TV:**
- Recording currently being watched
- Data received from remote control
- Websites being accessed
- Open applications

**Car "Follow Me" system:**
- Current distance from car in front
- Set/target distance from car in front
- Current speed of vehicle
- Current speed of vehicle in front
- Sensor readings
- Driver actions (e.g., steering, braking)
- Direction car is travelling

**Key principle:** RAM stores the **currently active/running** portions of data and applications, not complete static items.

## Exam Technique Reminders

1. **When asked for a difference, give both sides** -- "RAM is volatile, ROM is non-volatile" (not just "RAM is volatile")
2. **Be precise with virtual memory locations** -- secondary storage (not primary), return to RAM (not secondary storage or primary storage)
3. **Apply answers to the scenario** -- if a smart TV is mentioned, give TV-specific examples
4. **Show specificity in RAM examples** -- "currently running", "open", "being used", "active"
5. **Don't confuse purpose with characteristics** -- volatility is a characteristic; storing BIOS is a purpose
6. **Question is about WHY, not WHAT** -- "Why is storage needed?" requires reasons, not examples of storage types
