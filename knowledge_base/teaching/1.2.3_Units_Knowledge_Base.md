## Specification Requirements

### The units of data storage

**Students must know:**
- **Bit** -- the smallest unit of data storage, can be either 0 or 1
- **Nibble** -- 4 bits
- **Byte** -- 8 bits
- **Kilobyte (KB)** -- 1,000 bytes or 1 KB
- **Megabyte (MB)** -- 1,000 KB
- **Gigabyte (GB)** -- 1,000 MB
- **Terabyte (TB)** -- 1,000 GB
- **Petabyte (PB)** -- 1,000 TB
- The hierarchical relationship between units (each unit is 1,000 times the previous)
- How to convert between units by multiplying or dividing by 1,000

**Key distinction:** The specification uses base-10 conversions (1,000) as standard. However, base-2 conversions (1,024) are explicitly permitted as an alternative and will be accepted in calculations.

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "1,000" or "1,024" for conversions between units
- Accept: Calculations showing working with either 1,000 or 1,024
- Do not accept: Answers without showing working for multi-step calculations
- Do not accept: Incorrect order of magnitude (e.g. stating MB when answer should be KB)

**Not required:** Memorisation of binary equivalents of units (e.g. 2^10, 2^20, etc.)

### How data needs to be converted into a binary format to be processed by a computer

**Students must know:**
- All data must be stored in **binary format** (as combinations of 0s and 1s) because computers use electrical circuits that have two states: on (1) and off (0)
- **Analogue data** (continuous data like sound waves) must be converted to **digital data** (discrete binary values) before it can be processed by a computer
- Different types of data (numbers, text, images, sound) all use different methods to convert to binary format
- Computers can only process and store data in binary; it is the fundamental requirement for all computer operations

**Marking language:**
- Accept: "computers use electrical circuits with two states", "on and off", "current flows or doesn't flow"
- Accept: "all data must be in binary format", "computers only understand binary", "binary is the language of computers"
- Do not accept: Vague statements like "computers need binary" without explaining why
- Do not accept: Confusing binary with other number systems

**Not required:** Technical details of how circuits implement binary (transistors, logic gates, etc.)

### Data capacity and calculation of data capacity requirements

**Students must know:**
- Different storage devices have different **fixed capacities** (e.g. a USB drive might be 32 GB, a hard drive might be 2 TB)
- How to calculate the **required storage capacity** for a given set of files
- How to calculate file sizes for **sound files**: sample rate x duration (s) x bit depth
- How to calculate file sizes for **image files**: colour depth x image height (px) x image width (px)
- How to calculate file sizes for **text files**: bits per character x number of characters
- Multi-step calculations often require conversion between bits and bytes, and between byte units (KB, MB, GB, etc.)
- Working must be shown for calculations to gain full marks

**Key distinction:** File size calculations give results in **bits**. These must often be converted to bytes (divide by 8) and then to appropriate units (KB, MB, GB) by dividing by 1,000 (or 1,024 if using base-2).

| File Type | Formula | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Sound | sample rate x duration (s) x bit depth | 44,100 x 180 x 16 = 127,008,000 bits |
| Image | colour depth x height (px) x width (px) | 24 x 1080 x 1920 = 49,766,400 bits |
| Text | bits per character x number of characters | 8 x 5000 = 40,000 bits |

**Marking language:**
- Accept: Any correct method of calculation (statements, grids, algebraic working)
- Accept: Division by 1,024 instead of 1,000 (final answer will differ slightly)
- Accept: Allowance for metadata in calculations (if stated clearly)
- Accept: Partial marks for showing one correct stage of working
- Do not accept: Answers in bits when the question asks for KB or MB
- Do not accept: Forgetting to multiply by number of files when calculating total storage
- Do not accept: Final answer without showing working for multi-step problems

**Not required:** Knowledge of specific compression algorithms or formats

## Examiner Intelligence

### Recurring Misconceptions (flagged in examiner reports 2022-2025)

1. **"Colour depth increases the resolution of the image"**
   - Correction: **Colour depth** increases the number of colours available (bits per pixel), not the number of pixels. **Resolution** is determined by the number of pixels (height x width).
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report & June 2023 J277/01 examiner report -- "A common misconception is that colour depth increases the resolution of the image. This would need to be an increase in the resolution (the number of pixels) as opposed to the number of bits per pixel."

2. **"Giving the file size of one item when the question asks for multiple items"**
   - Correction: Read the question carefully. If it asks for the total file size of 10 images, you must multiply your calculation by 10.
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 examiner report -- "A common missed element was giving the file size of one image instead of multiplying it by 10 to give the file size of the ten images."

3. **"Confusing bits with values (e.g. 2^8 means there are 256 bits)"**
   - Correction: When asked how many bits are needed to represent a certain number of values, the answer is the number of bits (e.g. 8 bits), not the number of values those bits can represent (e.g. 256 values).
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 examiner report -- "Some candidates identified the need for 8 bits but gave the response to the question as 2^8, meaning that there would be 256 bits."

4. **"Metadata identifies the colour of each pixel"**
   - Correction: **Metadata** stores information *about* the image (e.g. number of pixels, date created, camera settings), not the colour of individual pixels. The colour of each pixel is stored in the image data itself.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report (and repeated in 2023) -- "A common misconception was that metadata identifies the colour of each pixel in the image."

5. **"Putting binary header numbers the wrong way around"**
   - Correction: Binary place values go from right to left: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 (not left to right).
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 examiner report -- "Some candidates put the binary header numbers the wrong way around, going from left to right, getting the binary number reversed."

### Common Mark Losses

- **Not showing working** for multi-step calculations -- working is explicitly required and 1 mark is typically allocated for showing correct intermediate steps
- **Giving answers in the wrong units** -- e.g. leaving answer in bits when the question asks for kilobytes
- **Not converting between bits and bytes** -- forgetting to divide by 8 when moving from bits to bytes
- **Ticking multiple boxes** in tick-box questions when only one answer is required -- OCR mark schemes specify "2+ ticks = 0 marks"
- **Incomplete conversions** -- e.g. calculating bytes but not converting to KB or MB when required
- **Not reading the question carefully** -- missing key details like "total file size for 10 images" vs "file size for 1 image"

### Question Patterns (2022-2025)

**Unit conversions (tick-box format):**
- Appears every year in June 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 papers
- Typically 1 mark per conversion, 3-4 conversions per question
- Common format: Match file sizes to equivalent units (e.g. "2000 bytes = ? KB")
- Mark scheme: "2+ ticks = 0 marks" -- students must tick exactly the correct number of boxes

**Identifying smallest/largest file size:**
- June 2023 (Q1c) -- identify largest from 2,000,000 bytes, 2300 KB, 200 MB, 0.1 GB -- 1 mark
- June 2024 (Q1ciii) -- identify smallest capacity from mixed units -- 1 mark
- June 2025 (Q5a) -- identify MB equivalent of 2 TB -- 1 mark
- Students must convert all values to the same unit to compare

**Identifying equal file sizes:**
- June 2022 (Q1d) and June 2023 (Q1d) -- tick two boxes that are equal
- Format: 4 options given, students tick exactly 2 that match
- Both years: 4,500,000 bytes and 4.5 MB were the correct answers
- 1 mark awarded only if both correct boxes ticked

**File size calculations:**
- June 2025 (Q1bii) -- calculate total file size of 10 images (colour depth, height, width given) -- 2 marks
- Format: 1 mark for showing working, 1 mark for correct answer
- Multi-step: pixels x colour depth = bits, divide by 8 for bytes, divide by 1,000 for KB, multiply by number of images
- June 2024 (Q1div) -- calculate storage for 3000 images (3 MB each) -- 2 marks

**Bits needed for values:**
- June 2025 (Q1biii) -- "How many bits are needed to represent 240 different values?" -- 1 mark (answer: 8)
- This concept appears regularly but students often confuse the number of bits with the number of values (2^n)

**Effects of changing colour depth:**
- June 2022 & 2023 (both Q1div) -- "State two effects of increasing colour depth to 2 bytes" -- 2 marks
- Accept: Quality improves, file size increases, more colours available
- Do not accept: Higher resolution, image size increases

**Gap in coverage:** No questions specifically testing the formulae for sound file calculations or text file calculations appeared in 2022-2025 papers, though these are in the specification.

## Quick Reference

### Unit Conversion Table

| Unit | Equivalent | Bits |
|------|------------|------|
| 1 bit | -- | 1 |
| 1 nibble | 4 bits | 4 |
| 1 byte | 8 bits | 8 |
| 1 KB | 1,000 bytes | 8,000 |
| 1 MB | 1,000 KB | 8,000,000 |
| 1 GB | 1,000 MB | 8,000,000,000 |
| 1 TB | 1,000 GB | 8,000,000,000,000 |
| 1 PB | 1,000 TB | 8,000,000,000,000,000 |

**Alternative (base-2):** Use 1,024 instead of 1,000 -- both are acceptable

### File Size Formulae (Results in Bits)

| Type | Formula | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Sound** | sample rate x duration (s) x bit depth | Sample rate in Hz (e.g. 44,100), duration in seconds |
| **Image** | colour depth x height (px) x width (px) | Colour depth in bits per pixel (e.g. 24 for 24-bit colour) |
| **Text** | bits per character x number of characters | Typically 8 bits (1 byte) per character |

**Critical conversion:** Divide by 8 to convert bits to bytes, then divide by 1,000 repeatedly to reach KB, MB, GB, etc.

### Calculation Strategy

1. **Identify what you're calculating:** sound, image, or text?
2. **Apply the correct formula** -- results will be in bits
3. **Convert to bytes:** divide by 8
4. **Convert to appropriate unit:** divide by 1,000 for each step (bits -> bytes -> KB -> MB -> GB)
5. **Multiply if calculating total:** if question asks for multiple files, multiply by the number
6. **Show your working:** always show intermediate steps for multi-step calculations

### Key Exam Language

**Say this:**
- "Data must be stored in binary format"
- "1 kilobyte = 1,000 bytes" (or "1,024 bytes" if using base-2)
- "Colour depth determines the number of colours available"
- "Resolution determines the number of pixels"
- "File size = [formula], then convert to appropriate units"

**Not that:**
- "Computers prefer binary" (too vague -- they *require* it)
- "Colour depth increases resolution" (incorrect -- colour depth affects colours, not pixel count)
- "Metadata stores the colours" (incorrect -- metadata stores information *about* the file)
- Answers without showing working for multi-step calculations
