# Unit 1.6.1: Ethical, Legal, Cultural and Environmental Impact
## OCR J277 GCSE Computer Science -- Knowledge Base File

---

## Specification Requirements

### 1. Impacts of digital technology on wider society

**Students must know:**
- Technology introduces **ethical**, **legal**, **cultural**, **environmental** and **privacy** issues
- Knowledge of a variety of examples of digital technology and how this impacts on society
- An ability to discuss the impact of technology based around the issues listed

**Ethical issues:**
- Whether it is morally right or wrong to use technology in a particular way
- Examples: surveillance without consent, AI decision-making, automation replacing jobs, digital divide (unequal access to technology), planned obsolescence forcing customers to upgrade devices

**Legal issues:**
- Whether the use of technology breaks or complies with the law
- Governed by specific legislation (see spec point 2 below)
- Examples: unauthorised access to data, sharing personal data without consent, copying software without a licence

**Cultural issues:**
- How technology changes the way people live, communicate and interact
- Examples: social media changing communication patterns, online shopping reducing high street use, increased screen time, changes to how people access entertainment and news, globalisation through internet access

**Environmental issues:**
- How technology affects the physical environment
- Examples: **e-waste** from discarded devices, energy consumption of data centres, use of rare earth materials in manufacturing, carbon footprint of device production and distribution, recycling of components

**Privacy issues:**
- How technology affects an individual's right to control their personal information
- Examples: tracking of online activity, collection of personal data by websites and apps, facial recognition in public spaces, location tracking via mobile devices

**Key distinction:** Ethical vs legal -- something can be legal but unethical (e.g. a company collecting excessive user data within the terms of a privacy policy), or illegal but arguably ethical (e.g. accessing a system without permission to expose a security flaw). Students should understand that ethical and legal are not the same thing. Note: the specification does not explicitly require this distinction, but it is implied by the separate listing of ethical and legal as distinct issue types, and understanding it helps students avoid conflating the two in extended responses.

**Marking language:**
- Accept: specific examples linked to the scenario given in the question; points that are expanded to explain why they are positive or negative
- Do not accept: single-word answers without expansion (e.g. just "privacy"); generic statements not linked to the scenario (e.g. "AI will take over the world"); points about technology in general that ignore the specific context of the question

**Not required:** Detailed knowledge of specific real-world case studies or named companies (though these may be used as examples). The specification requires students to discuss impacts, not to recall specific news stories.

### 2. Legislation relevant to Computer Science

**Students must know:**
- The purpose of each piece of legislation and the specific actions it allows or prohibits
- The need to license software and the purpose of a software licence (see spec point 3 below)

#### The Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA)

- Governs how **personal data** is collected, stored, used and shared
- Organisations must keep data **secure** from unauthorised access
- Data must be **accurate** and kept **up to date**
- Data must only be kept for as long as **necessary** and for the **purpose** it was collected
- Data must **not be shared** without the individual's **consent**
- Individuals have the right to **access** their data and request it be **deleted**
- Individuals must be **informed** that their data is being collected
- Organisations must not transfer data to countries with lower levels of data protection

**Marking language:**
- Accept: Data Protection Act 2018 // DPA // GDPR // Data protection (June 2025 J277/01 MS)
- Accept: specific steps such as "keep data secure", "do not share without consent", "delete when no longer needed", "allow access when requested", "keep data up to date"
- Do not accept: vague descriptions of legislation used in place of the name, e.g. "to keep data secure" as an identification of the legislation (June 2025 J277/01 ER)

#### Computer Misuse Act 1990 (CMA)

- Makes it illegal to gain **unauthorised access** to computer systems or data
- The specification requires students to know the purpose of the CMA and what it prohibits
- Three levels of offence (useful teacher context; the specification does not require students to name all three, but understanding them helps with application):
  - Unauthorised access to computer material (e.g. guessing someone's password and logging in)
  - Unauthorised access with intent to commit further offences (e.g. accessing a bank system to steal money)
  - Unauthorised modification of computer material (e.g. deliberately planting a virus or deleting files)

**Marking language:**
- Accept: clear identification of unauthorised access as the key concept
- Do not accept: confusing CMA with DPA when the scenario involves accessing someone else's account

#### Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 (CDPA)

- Protects the **intellectual property** of creators -- their original works, designs and inventions
- Makes it illegal to **copy, distribute or modify** someone else's work without permission
- Applies to software, music, images, text and other digital content
- In UK law, creators automatically have copyright when they create an original work (useful context; the specification does not explicitly state this but it underpins the purpose of the act)

**Marking language:**
- Accept: references to copying, replicating or distributing work without permission
- Do not accept: confusing CDPA with CMA when the scenario involves copying software rather than accessing systems

**Key distinction:** DPA = personal data; CMA = unauthorised access to systems; CDPA = copying/using someone else's creative work. Students frequently confuse which legislation applies to which scenario (June 2022 J277/01 ER -- "answered well by many candidates who correctly identified the legislation").

---

### 3. Software licences

**Students must know:**
- The need to license software and the purpose of a **software licence**
- Features of **open source** (providing access to the source code and the ability to change the software)
- Features of **proprietary** (no access to the source code, purchased commonly as off-the-shelf)
- Recommend a type of licence for a given scenario including benefits and drawbacks

#### Open source software

- **Source code** is provided and can be accessed by anyone
- Users can **view, modify and distribute** the software
- Usually available **free of charge** (though not always)
- Benefits: free/low cost; can be customised to meet specific needs; community of developers can identify and fix bugs; wider access for users who cannot afford proprietary alternatives
- Drawbacks: limited official documentation and support; potential security risk if code is modified maliciously; no guarantee of quality; may be less polished or user-friendly

#### Proprietary software

- Source code is **not provided** -- users cannot view or modify it
- Purchased at a **cost** (commonly sold as **off-the-shelf** software)
- Users agree to licence terms that restrict how the software can be used
- Benefits: usually well-tested and reliable; comes with official support and documentation; more control for the developer over how the software is used; developer can earn revenue
- Drawbacks: costs money to purchase; cannot be modified to meet specific needs; users are dependent on the developer for updates and bug fixes; may restrict the number of devices it can be installed on

| Feature | Open Source | Proprietary |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Source code | Provided | Not provided |
| Cost | Usually free | Purchased at a cost |
| Modification | Can be changed | Cannot be changed |
| Distribution | Can be redistributed | Restricted by licence |
| Support | Community-based | Official/paid support |
| Also known as | Free and open-source software | Off-the-shelf / commercial |

**Key mark scheme insight:** The June 2024 J277/01 MS states that "Both provide copyright" -- i.e. open source software is still protected by copyright. The June 2022 and 2023 J277/01 MS both state "Do not award reference to ownership/copyright because both allow copyright of the code/program" for the proprietary benefits question. Students must not claim that only proprietary software has copyright protection.

**Marking language (software licences):**
- Accept: "can access/change source code" for open source; "cannot access/change code" for proprietary (June 2024 J277/01 MS)
- Accept: either licence can be recommended, provided the justification is linked to the scenario
- Do not accept: describing each licence without making a clear recommendation when the question asks for one (June 2024 J277/01 ER)

**Not required:** Knowledge of specific open source licences (e.g. GPL, MIT, Apache) -- the specification only requires open source and proprietary as categories.

## Examiner Intelligence

### Recurring Misconceptions (flagged in examiner reports 2022-2025)

1. **"Students write entirely negative responses to discuss questions"**
   - Extended response questions require a balanced discussion of positives and negatives. Heavily one-sided responses cannot access the top mark band.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 ER -- "Many responses were heavily negative, identifying a lack of privacy and trust, without identifying many positive features"
   - Source: June 2023 J277/01 ER -- "Some responses gave strongly negative arguments with little, if any, consideration for the positive impacts"
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 ER -- "Candidates often focused on the drawbacks of the decision"

2. **"Students give generic answers about technology instead of addressing the specific scenario"**
   - Responses must be tied to the context given in the question. Generic answers about AI or technology in general do not gain credit.
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 ER -- "Some responses evolved into generic answers about AI in the world, for example developing into robots that are living organisms, instead of focusing on the use of AI for monitoring posts on a social networking website"
   - Source: June 2023 J277/01 ER -- "Some of the less successful responses focused on people not wanting to be watched by CCTV cameras" when the question was about upgrading existing CCTV to include facial recognition

3. **"Students confuse which legislation applies to which scenario"**
   - DPA, CMA and CDPA each cover distinct areas. Students sometimes name the wrong act.
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 ER -- "Some candidates inaccurately identified the Computer Misuse Act or Copyright Designs and Patents Act, which are not followed when storing user's data"

4. **"Students describe legislation rather than naming it"**
   - When asked to identify a piece of legislation, students must give the name of the act, not describe what it does.
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 ER -- "Some identifications were descriptions of legislation, for example to keep data secure, instead of the actual name of the legislation"

5. **"Students describe each licence but do not make a recommendation when asked for one"**
   - When a question explicitly asks for a recommendation, students must state which licence they recommend and justify it.
   - Source: June 2024 J277/01 ER -- "Fewer candidates included a recommendation for the programmer. Candidates described each in turn without identifying which one should be used"

6. **"Students make single-word or unexpanded points in extended responses"**
   - Points must be expanded to explain why they are relevant. Stating a point without explaining its significance does not gain full credit.
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 ER -- "When using bullets and tables candidates need to make sure they include their expansions alongside"
   - Source: June 2022 J277/01 ER -- "These bullet points were not single words, they included appropriate descriptions and explanations where required"

7. **"Students only consider benefits from one perspective (e.g. only the company, not the customer)"**
   - Top-band responses consider multiple stakeholders.
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 MS -- "References both customer and company clearly for top of band"
   - Source: June 2025 J277/01 ER -- "Fewer responses considered a range of potential benefits beyond the increased profit for the company"

### Common Mark Losses

- Giving a single-word response (e.g. "privacy") without expansion or explanation
- Writing a one-sided argument (all positive or all negative) in a "discuss" question -- this caps the response at mid-band
- Failing to address all bullet points listed in the question (e.g. covering ethical but not environmental issues)
- Not linking points to the scenario -- generic statements about technology that could apply to anything
- Describing legislation instead of naming it when asked to "identify"
- Not providing a recommendation when the question explicitly asks for one
- Failing to expand points -- stating a fact without explaining why it matters or how it affects stakeholders
- Confusing legislation categories (e.g. citing CMA when the scenario is about personal data storage)

### Question Patterns (2022-2025)

| Year | Paper | Question | Topic Focus | Marks | Format |
|------|-------|----------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 2022 | J277/01 | Q4* | AI monitoring social media posts -- legal, ethical, privacy issues | 8 | Extended response (QWC) |
| 2022 | J277/01 | Q5(c) | Legislation identification -- matching events to DPA/CMA/CDPA | 5 | Tick-box table |
| 2022 | J277/01 | Q5(d)(i) | Benefits to developer of releasing software as proprietary | 4 | Short response (Describe) |
| 2022 | J277/01 | Q5(d)(ii) | Benefit to users of releasing software as open source | 2 | Short response (Describe) |
| 2023 | J277/01 | Q5(d)(i) | Benefits to developer of releasing software as proprietary | 4 | Short response (Describe) |
| 2023 | J277/01 | Q5(d)(ii) | Benefit to users of releasing software as open source | 2 | Short response (Describe) |
| 2023 | J277/01 | Q6* | Facial recognition CCTV upgrade -- ethical, privacy, legal issues | 8 | Extended response (QWC) |
| 2024 | J277/01 | Q4* | Open source vs proprietary licences -- features, legal/ethical, benefits/drawbacks, recommendation | 8 | Extended response (QWC) |
| 2025 | J277/01 | Q3* | Planned obsolescence -- ethical, environmental issues, benefits and drawbacks for company and customers | 8 | Extended response (QWC) |
| 2025 | J277/01 | Q4(f) | Identify legislation for storing user data + describe steps for compliance | 4 | Short response |

**Note on 2022 and 2023 Q5(d):** Both years used an identical scenario (artist and programmer developing image editing software). The examiner report images confirm Q5(d)(i) and Q5(d)(ii) as the correct question references. The 2022 and 2023 mark schemes in the project files contain identical indicative content for this question.

**Note on 2022 Q4 mark scheme:** The 2022 J277/01 mark scheme file in the project contains indicative content for a CCTV/facial recognition scenario, which matches the 2023 Q6 scenario rather than the 2022 Q4 AI/social media scenario. The 2022 exam paper and examiner report both confirm Q4 was about AI monitoring posts on social networking websites. The indicative content in the mark scheme file appears to be a compilation error. Examiner intelligence for the 2022 Q4 is therefore drawn from the examiner report only.

**Key patterns:**
- 1.6.1 is examined **every year** and carries **high mark weight** (8 marks for extended response + additional shorter questions)
- The 8-mark extended response (QWC) question has been drawn from 1.6.1 in every sitting from 2022-2025
- Extended responses always use the "Discuss" command word and provide bullet points listing the required issue types
- The scenario changes each year but the structure is consistent: a technology application + a set of issue types to address
- **Software licences** (open source vs proprietary) have been examined in **every year** from 2022-2025: as short-answer Describe questions in 2022 and 2023, and as the 8-mark QWC in 2024
- Legislation has appeared as both tick-box identification (2022) and short-answer identification + description (2025)
- Cultural issues have **not been directly examined** in any paper from 2022-2025
- Environmental issues were first examined as a named bullet point in the 8-mark QWC in 2025

**Assessment objective split for extended responses:** AO2 1a (4 marks) + AO2 1b (4 marks) -- application of knowledge and understanding to the given context

## Quick Reference

### Five Issue Types at a Glance

| Issue Type | Core Question | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Ethical | Is it morally right? | Planned obsolescence -- unfair on customers? |
| Legal | Does it break the law? | Storing data without following DPA |
| Cultural | How does it change how people live? | Social media changing communication |
| Environmental | How does it affect the planet? | E-waste from discarded devices |
| Privacy | Who can see my personal information? | Facial recognition tracking individuals |

### Legislation Quick Reference

| Legislation | Year | Covers | Key Phrase |
|-------------|------|--------|-----------|
| Data Protection Act | 2018 | Personal data -- collection, storage, use, sharing | "personal data must be kept secure and not shared without consent" |
| Computer Misuse Act | 1990 | Unauthorised access to computer systems | "accessing a computer system without permission" |
| Copyright Designs and Patents Act | 1988 | Intellectual property -- creative works, software, designs | "copying or distributing someone else's work without permission" |

### Key Exam Language

**Say this:**
- "The Data Protection Act 2018 requires organisations to..." (name the legislation first)
- "This is an ethical issue because..." (label the issue type, then explain)
- "A benefit of this for the customer is..." / "A drawback for the company is..." (identify the stakeholder)
- "I would recommend open source because..." (clear recommendation + justification)
- "This could lead to an increase in e-waste because..." (expand the point)

**Not this:**
- "The law says you can't do that" (which law? Be specific)
- "This is bad for privacy" (why? Expand the point)
- "Both licences are suitable so it depends on the programmer" (this is not a recommendation -- June 2024 J277/01 ER)
- "AI will take over the world" (generic, not linked to the scenario -- June 2022 J277/01 ER)
- "People don't like being watched" (too vague -- which people? Why? What is the specific concern?)

### Extended Response (8-mark QWC) Structure Guide

Based on examiner feedback across 2022-2025, successful responses:

1. Address **each bullet point** given in the question (e.g. ethical, environmental, benefits and drawbacks)
2. Include **both positives and negatives** for a balanced discussion
3. **Expand** each point -- state the issue, then explain why it matters
4. Consider **multiple stakeholders** (e.g. customer and company, or user and organisation)
5. Link every point to the **specific scenario** in the question
6. Use **structure** (headers, bullet points, or clear paragraphs for each issue type) to ensure coverage
7. Where asked, provide a **clear recommendation with justification**

---

## Source Material Gaps

- **Cultural issues:** No direct past paper question has focused on cultural issues as a named requirement (2022-2025). The specification includes cultural issues in the list of impacts. This is a potential examination target.
- **Environmental issues as standalone topic:** Only examined as a named bullet point in June 2025 Q3. Prior papers folded environmental issues into broader discussions or did not name them explicitly.
- **Computer Misuse Act -- detailed application:** No extended question has required students to apply CMA to a scenario in depth. It has appeared only in the tick-box legislation matching question (June 2022 Q5c).
- **Copyright Designs and Patents Act -- detailed application:** Similarly, CDPA has not been the focus of an extended question. It has appeared in tick-box matching (June 2022 Q5c) and was referenced within the open source/proprietary discussion (June 2024 Q4).
