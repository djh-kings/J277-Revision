## Question 3 — Data Representation: Characters, Images, Compression [14 marks]
**Unit:** 1.2 (Memory and Storage — data representation)
**Scope:** ✅ In scope

### 3(a) [5 marks]
**Command word:** Complete

One form of data is characters.

Complete the description of how computers represent characters in binary using the given list of terms. Not all terms will be used.

**Word bank:** 2, 4, 8, 9, 16, 32, 256, 71, 72, 74, 76, 78, 80, 81, all, different, identical, one, repeated, similar, some, unique

A character set stores ......... of the characters that the computer can represent. Each character is given a ......... binary code. Lower-case and upper-case letters in a character set are given ......... binary codes.

One example of a character set is ASCII. This character set uses ......... bits for each character. If the code value for the character 'F' is 70 then the code value for the character 'L' is ......... .

### 3(b)(i) [1 mark]
**Command word:** State

The table shows the colours used in an image and the binary value for each colour.

| Colour | Binary value |
|--------|-------------|
| Red | 0000 |
| Green | 0010 |
| Blue | 1000 |
| Purple | 0110 |

The metadata states that the image is 3 pixels wide by 4 pixels high. The data in the file starts in the top left of the image and goes from left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

State what is meant by metadata in an image file.

### 3(b)(ii) [2 marks]
**Command word:** Write (complete grid)

The binary data stored for the image is given:

`000000000110100000101000011001100110000000101000`

A grid is given for the image (3 columns × 4 rows). Each square is one pixel.

Write the name of the colour in each square that the pixel will show for this image.

### 3(b)(iii) [1 mark]
**Command word:** State

A colour depth of 4 is used. This means 4 bits are used to store the colour for each pixel.

State the maximum number of different colours that can be represented in 4-bits.

### 3(b)(iv) [2 marks]
**Command word:** State

The colour depth is increased to 2 bytes.

State two effects that this change can have on the image.

### 3(c)(i) [3 marks]
**Command word:** Identify + Justify

A student has a text document and an image file that need to be compressed separately. The student needs to reduce the file size of both of these files as much as possible.

Identify the most suitable type of compression for the text document. Justify your choice.

### 3(c)(ii) [3 marks]
**Command word:** Identify + Justify

Identify the most suitable type of compression for the image file. Justify your choice.
